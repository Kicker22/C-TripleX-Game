# C-TripleX-Game
This is a game I made that uses the command line to run a very basic number guessing game in C++.

In order to run you will ned to...
1.Open VS code through the developer terminal
2.Then compile the game in the terminal  using the command.. cl trippleX.cpp
3. Then to run the game use the command trippleX.exe

You then be able to play using the terminal.
